# Traveling-Salesman-Problem-Various-Algorithms-
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), a famous non-deterministic polynomial-complete (NP-Complete) problem, was explored using a variety of approaches like Brute Force, BFS/DFS, Closest Edge Insertion (Greedy), Genetic Algorithm, and Wisdom of Artificial Crowds to find the shortest and most cost-efficient route for a salesman to be able to visit every single city from the starting city. The different approaches above help to analyze differences between the algorithm runtimes when dealing with complex TSP datasets where approaches like Brute Force, BFS, DFS, or Closest Edge Insertion would be inefficient as the number of cities increases.
